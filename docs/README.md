## Quickstart <a id="quickstart"></a>

1. Clone the repository

    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:wmde/wikidata-mismatch-finder.git
    cd wikidata-mismatch-finder
    ```

1. Install dependencies with composer (requires composer 2+)

    ```bash
    composer install
    ```

    **OR** use docker to install dependencies

    ```bash
    docker run --rm \
        -u "$(id -u):$(id -g)" \
        -v $(pwd):/opt \
        -w /opt \
        laravelsail/php80-composer:latest \
        composer install --ignore-platform-reqs
    ```

1. Copy default environment variables

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

1. Start the application server with Laravel sail

    ```bash
    ./vendor/bin/sail up
    ```

    **HOT TIP!** Add the following alias to your `.bashrc` or `.profile` for easier command execution

    ```bash
    alias sail='bash vendor/bin/sail'
    ```

1. Generate a unique app key with artisan

    ```bash
    sail artisan key:generate
    ```

1. Run database migrations to create initial tables

    ```bash
   sail artisan migrate
    ```

1. Install `npm` dependencies

    ```bash
    sail npm install
    ```

1. Build the frontend code so you can see the javascript content of the app. 

    ```bash
    sail npm run dev
    ```

For more advanced frontend topics, see [Frontend - Working with CSS and JS](#frontend)

## Day to day <a id="day-to-day"></a>

### Start the application server

```bash
sail up
```

**OR** if you don't want to see live logging, start it in detached mode

```bash
sail up -d
```

### Stop the application server

```bash
sail down
```

### Destroy all the things

**DANGER!** Not only does this remove all downloaded images - which will result in some setup time when running `sail up` again, this will also **delete** all the data volumes for your application, removing all data from the database.

```bash
sail down --rmi all -v
```

## Working with OAuth <a id="oauth"></a>

In production, this application relies on wikidata.org's OAuth capabilities in order to authorize and identify users. Since it is not ideal to test in the production environment, we recommend creating your own personal OAuth consumer credentials for testing purposes, in order to develop locally.

1. Register your local testing app against wikidata in the following link:

    [OAuth Consumer Registration](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:OAuthConsumerRegistration/propose)

1. Fill in the following fields in the form as follows (see [screenshot](gallery/Screenshot_2021-06-28_at_18-06-22_OAuth_consumer_registration_-_Meta.md) for example):
    - **Application name:** Make sure to include ***test*** in the name of the application, so that it is apparent for reviewers in the Wikimedia Foundation (WMF) that your consumer is meant for testing purposes.
    - **OAuth protocol version:** Leave this field as is. This application uses OAuth1.0a.
    - **Application description:** Fill in a description for your application, to make review easier.
    - **OAuth "callback" URL:** Make sure to fill this in with a ***localhost*** address, with the port you would be running this application on (if not using the default port). This should be identical to the `APP_URL` in your `.env` file.
    Please also make sure you tick the checkbox next to "Allow consumer to specify a callback in requests and use "callback" URL above as required prefix."
    - **Applicable project:** This field should be set to `wikidatawiki`.
    - **Types of grants being requested:** Make sure to check the first radio button - "User identity verification only, no ability to read pages or act on a user's behalf". This will speed up the review process.

    The rest of the fields can stay on their default values. Don't forget to check the disclaimer before submitting the form.

1. Once the form is submitted, make sure to write down your consumer key and consumer secret in a safe place and fill in the details in your local `.env` file:

    ```bash
    #...

    MEDIAWIKI_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=<your-consumer-key>
    MEDIAWIKI_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET=<your-consumer-secret>
    MEDIAWIKI_OAUTH_CALLBACK_URL="${APP_URL}/auth/callback"
    MEDIAWIKI_OAUTH_BASE_URL=https://www.wikidata.org

    #...
    ```

1. As soon as you receive the email from the WMF team that your consumer is approved, you may start testing your application by logging in through your local instance's home page.

## Frontend - Working with CSS and JS <a id="frontend"></a>

Add the JS and CSS code in the `resources/js` and `resources/css` folder respectively.

Laravel mix (and webpack in the background) is responsible for compiling all of the frontend assets placed in these resources subfolders.

Before you begin working with frontend assets, please make sure to install `npm` dependencies:

```
sail npm install
```

**Important!** Please only run `npm install` using [sail](#quickstart), or make sure that your local node.js version is the similar to sail: 16 or above.

To watch for changes in your frontend files, simply run:

```
sail npm run watch
```

To manually compile assets for your local dev environment run:

```
sail npm run dev
```

## Localization and Internationalization

The Mismatch Finder application employs two separate localization systems: one for the server-side Laravel  app, and another for the vue based client-side application.

To switch to any other language than English, set the `uselang` parameter in the URL. For example, to set the language to German:

```
http://<your-localhost>/?uselang=de
```

On the server side, we fully employ the default [Laravel localization system](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/localization) and syntax, and messages in the server side should be added as or to php files in the `resources/lang/en` directory.

The client side localization system utilizes the [banana-i18n](https://www.npmjs.com/package/banana-i18n) library and format. Messages for the client side application are kept in the `public/i18n/` directory, and are served in order to be consumed by the vue client. Each message that is added to the `en.json` file, should be documented in the `qqq.json` file as well, to provide more context for translators.

To ensure that your client side localization files are valid, run:

```
sail npm run i18n:validate
```

## Job Queues

As the Mismatch Finder includes jobs to validate and import mismatch CSV files, it is possible to also configure the job queue runner to run locally.

By Default, the jobs will run synchronously to the requests that dispatch them. However, in order to queue and run jobs from the database, simple follow these two steps:

1. In your local `.env` file, change the value of `QUEUE_CONNECTION` to `database` (it should be set to `sync` by default).

1. Start the job queue runner by typing in the following command: 

    ```
    sail artisan queue:listen --timeout=1200
    ```

    The `--timeout=1200` flag in the command above increases the job timeout to 20 minutes thus ensuring that the queue worker doesn't abort jobs that take longer than a minute.
## Linting <a id="linting"></a>
### PHP Linting <a id="php-linting"></a>

The application uses `phpcs` to detect code format violations.

To run phpcs: `sail composer run lint`

To fix style errors automatically run: `sail composer run fix` 

Note: Laravel uses the [PSR2](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/) Standard which expects camel caps method names. So you might get the error: `Method name my_method() is not in camel caps` if you scaffold your application. The recommendation there is to change the method names to camel case.

### Javascript Linting <a id="js-linting"></a>

The application uses ESLint to detect code format violations in the frontend's `*.js` and `*.vue` files.

To run eslint: `sail npm run lint`

To fix style errors automatically run: `sail npm run lint:fix` 

## Testing <a id="testing"></a>

### PHP Testing <a id="php-testing"></a>

The Laravel framework supports two types of testing: unit and feature tests. In contrast to unit tests, feature tests will boot your Laravel application and therefore are able to access your application's database and other framework services.

Mismatch finder uses an in-memory SQLite database for testing, so that the feature tests will leave your mariadb instance untouched. You can find the config settings for sqlite in `phpunit.xml`:

```
    <php>
        [...]
        <server name="DB_CONNECTION" value="sqlite"/>
        <server name="DB_DATABASE" value=":memory:"/>
        [...]
    </php>
```

Simply run `# sail artisan test` to start both unit and integration tests:

```
$ sail artisan test

   PASS  Tests\Unit\ExampleTest
  ✓ example

   PASS  Tests\Feature\ExampleTest
  ✓ example

  Tests:  2 passed
  Time:   0.16s
```

### Javascript Testing <a id="javascript-testing"></a>

To test our Javascript code in general, and any vue components or pages we create in particular, this repository utilizes the jest test runner. In order to run JS tests, use the following command:

```
sail npm test
```

### Browser Testing <a id="browser-testing"></a>

The app uses [Laravel Dusk](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/dusk) as the Browser testing framework. Dusk uses a ChromeDriver installation, since we are using [Laravel Sail](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/sail#laravel-dusk), a standalone chrome installation is included in the docker setup.

To create an enviroment variables file for local browser tests, make a copy of the `.env.dusk.example` file named `.env.dusk.local` and fill in the APP_KEY with your unique app key. Your APP KEY should be the one created when setting up the project in the [quickstart guide](#quickstart). You can find it in your `.env` file.

A one time setup is required before running the browser tests. This will create the tables needed for dusk:

```bash
$ docker container ls # note down the id of the mysql container

$ docker exec -it <mysql container id> mysql -ppassword

MariaDB [(none)]> CREATE DATABASE dusk character set UTF8mb4 collate utf8mb4_bin;
```

To run all the browser tests:

```
sail dusk
```

## Staging <a id="staging"></a>

When there are changes that need to be tested before being deployed to production, like an UX decision or testing a new feature, the [Mismatch Finder staging server](https://mismatch-finder-staging.toolforge.org/) can be used. 

To deploy to this server, push your commits to a branch starting with the name `staging/`. 
For example `staging/my_branch_name`. The changes in the branch will be deployed to the server after all the checks have passed.

## Troubleshooting <a id="troubleshooting"></a>

### Address already in use

#### MariaDB

**Problem:** Sail refuses to start with the following error.

```
ERROR: for wikidata-mismatch-finder_mariadb_1
Cannot start service mariadb: driver failed programming external connectivity on endpoint 
wikidata-mismatch-finder_mariadb_1 (dbd1f278da0a5edb416b7875f224b83d1f2c08feac6e9a31d01d28567b83b4c7):
Error starting userland proxy: listen tcp4 0.0.0.0:3306: bind: address already in use
```

**Possible Explanation:** This error most probably occurs when you already have a local system-wide instance of MySQL or MariaDB running on the default port `3306`.

**Solution:** Set the port to something other than `3306` using the `FORWARD_DB_PORT` environment variable.

***While running the app:***

```bash
FORWARD_DB_PORT=3308 sail up
```

OR ***In your `.env` file:***

```bash
##...
APP_DEBUG=true
APP_URL=http://localhost

FORWARD_DB_PORT=3308
##...
```

#### `laravel.test`

**Problem:** Sail refuses to start with the following error.

```
ERROR: for wikidata-mismatch-finder_laravel.test_1
Cannot start service laravel.test: driver failed programming external connectivity on endpoint 
wikidata-mismatch-finder_laravel.test_1 (0fa137072f412614077154ca7927cbb0ca2f3df5474879bb5e8e33f15a1683e3): 
Error starting userland proxy: listen tcp4 0.0.0.0:80: bind: address already in use
```

**Possible Explanation:** This error most probably occurs when you already have a local web server running on the default port `80`.

**Solution:** Set the port to something other than `80` using the `APP_PORT` environment variable.

***While running the app:***

```bash
APP_PORT=1337 sail up
```

OR ***In your `.env` file:***

```bash
##...
APP_DEBUG=true
APP_URL=http://localhost:1337

APP_PORT=1337
##...
```

### OAuth Error retrieving temporary credentials

**Problem:** The local server returns this error on clicking the log in link.

```
League\OAuth1\Client\Credentials\CredentialsException
Error in retrieving temporary credentials.
http://localhost/auth/login
```

**Possible Explanation:**

If, after following the steps in the [Working with OAuth section](#oauth), you are getting this error - this can be due to either misconfigured consumer keys, a wrong app url, or simply an attempt to authorize a consumer that is still pending WMF review.

**Solution:**

1. Make sure your `MEDIAWIKI_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` and `MEDIAWIKI_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET` are correctly set to your consumer key and secret in your local `.env` file.
1. Make sure that your `APP_URL` is set correctly to your localhost address and the port your application is running on (if running on a non default port).
1. Double check to see that the WMF has emailed to approve your localhost OAuth consumer, if they have not responded yet, please wait patiently, as the review process might take a few hours.

## Chore: Updating dependencies

### Npm dependencies

You can see which dependencies have new releases by first making sure your local dependencies are up-to-date by executing `npm ci` and then running `npm outdated`.
The query builder uses the latest full release of Wikit which works on Vue 2.6. For this reason we do not update any of the following packages till further notice:
- vue
- vuex
- vue-banana-i18n
- vite
- @vue/test-utils
- @vitejs/plugin-vue
- vue-template-compiler

All other dependencies should generally be updated to the latest version. If you discover that a dependency should not be updated for some reason, please add it to the above list. If a dependency can only be updated with substantial manual work, you can create a new task for it and skip it in the context of the current chore.

The recommended way to update dependencies is to collect related dependency updates into grouped commits; this keeps the number of commits to review manageable (compared to having one commit for every update), while keeping the scope of each commit limited and increasing reviewability and debuggability (compared to combining all updates in a single commit). For example, this can be one commit for each of:
- all ESLint-related dependency updates
- all Jest-related dependency updates
- all Vue-related dependency updates
- all PostCSS/Stylelint-related dependency updates
- `npm update` for all other dependency updates

Make sure the app is running: `sail up -d`.
Then make sure that all unit tests still pass and building still works for every local commit using:
- `sail npm run test` for unit tests.
- `sail dusk` for browser tests.

### Composer dependencies

Since Mismatch Finder is using Laravel, we need to make sure that we update backend dependencies as well. To do this, run `composer outdated`.

Update the dependencies that need updating in the `composer.json` file. Create a single commit for each update. And then run `composer update` to install the new packages.

Then make sure that all unit tests still pass and building still works for every local commit using `sail artisan test`.

Don't update to any major version of Laravel since that would require a migration and would be out of the scope of a chore.
